# SMB
NVDA add-on for Sao Mai Braille program.  
Version 25.5  
Copyright 2022 - 2025 by Sao Mai Technology Team

Sao Mai Braille (SMB) is a free rich text editing and Braille translation software for Windows, developed by [Sao Mai Center for the Blind](https://www.saomaicenter.org/en).
Right now, there are some accessibility that can't be fixed in the program itself so this small add-on will make NVDA screen reader more accessible to SMB's interface.
More info about this program can be found at <https://www.saomaicenter.org/en/smsoft/smb>

# Hotkeys Deprecated
Since SMB version 25.5, the following hotkey will be deprecated:

- Alt+F9: Insert equation dialog
- Alt+F10: Insert Picture dialog
- Alt+F11: Insert Music Score

Instead, we'll use:

- Ctrl+Shift+Q:  Insert equation dialog
- Ctrl+Shift+G: Insert Picture dialog
- Ctrl+Shift+M: Insert Music Score

This could be easier to remember.
However, users may already be familiar with the old hotkeys.
Therefore, this add-on has integrated the old command keys so you can use both types of shortcuts in parallel.
That said, we still encourage you to use the new shortcuts because of the benefits they bring.

# Translating add-on
Currently, this add-on contains strings for the input help message of the old SMB hotkeys, as well as this README file.
You can translate them via [SMB repository on GitHub](https://github.com/manhcuong0312/SMB),
or contact us using the information in the Support and Feedback section if you're not familiar with that platform.
