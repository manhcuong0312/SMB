# SMB
Add-on for Sao Mai Braille program.

Sao Mai Braille (SMB) is a free rich text editing and Braille translation software for Windows, developed by [Sao Mai Center for the Blind](https://www.saomaicenter.org/en).
This is a small add-on to make NVDA screen reader more accessible to SMB's interface.
More info about this program can be found at <https://www.saomaicenter.org/en/smsoft/smb>

# Translating add-on
Right now, this add-on just make NVDA reads smb's interface better, no extra functionality added so strings to translate is just add-on's description and this readme file. Both are not require. However, if you'd like, you can translate those via [SMB on Github](https://github.com/Sao-Mai-Center/SMB), or contact us using info below.
